# Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL)

See [Workflows](workflows.md) for specific examples of workflows using data on the Cell Painting Gallery including examples using machine learning.

## Compressed images

As machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) workflows often benefit from image compression, we provide the following compressed images.
We welcome contributions of compressed images for any other datasets in the Cell Painting Gallery.

| Dataset | Location | Description |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| cpg0004-lincs | cpg0019-moshkov-deepprofiler/broad/training_images/LINCS/ | single cell .png crops with cell masks |
